# QPang Legacy

QPang Legacy is a mod for QPang version 20120314, the same version the [Essence Emulator](https://github.com/Deluze/qpang-essence-emulator) was built for.\
The goal of this mod is to bring back the aesthetic of legacy QPang versions, such as the user interface and the plaza.\
It is overall finished, but some things are still missing. (Boosting UI, trading UI, probably more...)\
There are currently no plans to add these in, but feel free to create a fork and do it yourself!\
The Lua UI scripts were accessed and modified through use of a custom [open source tool](https://github.com/kuroppoi/qpang-toolkit).
